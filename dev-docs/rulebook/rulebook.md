3. **Meet Delays:** In the event of inclement weather or minor facility issues that arise before or during a meet, every effort should be made to run the meet as planned. The Referee and both GPSA Representatives shall confer and may temporarily delay the start or suspend the meet (e.g., in 30-minute increments) to await safe, competitive conditions.

4. **Postponement:** A meet that cannot be safely started or continued may be postponed.

   1. **Weather/Facility Postponement:** If conditions are clearly unsafe or the facility is unusable, the home team must notify the visiting team's GPSA Representative and the GPSA Publicity Committee as soon as possible.

   2. **Mutual Agreement:** A meet may be postponed at any time with the unanimous agreement of both teams' GPSA Representatives.

5. **Rescheduling Process:**

   1. Upon postponement, the GPSA Representatives' first priority is to agree on a date to hold the meet as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., the next day).

   2. If an immediate alternative date cannot be mutually agreed upon, the meet shall be held on the next available official league rain date.

   3. A final, rescheduled date **must** be confirmed by both Representatives within 24 hours of the initial postponement.

6. **Defining a Completed Meet:**

   1. A meet that is stopped and cannot be resumed is considered **complete** if all events through event 30 (15-18 50M Breast) have been swum.

   2. If a meet is stopped before the completion of event 30, it is considered a **suspended meet** and must be rescheduled and completed at a later date.

   3. Notwithstanding the above, the two GPSA Representatives may mutually agree that a meet is complete at any point after it has begun.

7. **Failure to Reschedule:**

   1. The collaborative rescheduling of a suspended meet is a primary responsibility of both GPSA Representatives, who are expected to begin discussions on the night of the postponement.

   2. If the Representatives fail to agree on a reschedule date within the 24-hour period required by rule 5.3, the meet shall be declared a **loss for both teams.**

# AWARDS {#awards}

## Meet Awards

   1. The home pool shall award first (blue), second (red), and third (white) place ribbons for all individual events, and first place ribbons (blue) to all participants on winning relay teams.

   2. The design of these ribbons will be at the discretion of the home pool.

   3. Such awards shall be given to the Coaches or GPSA Representatives after the meet or mailed to the GPSA Representative the following day.

   4. Additional ribbons for 4th place or participation may be awarded at the discretion of the home pool.

   5. Any awards referencing disqualifications shall be given directly to the respective coach along with the disqualification slip and shall not be included with the regular meet awards.

## Division Awards

   1. Trophies shall be awarded to the teams finishing 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in each division.

   2. If two teams have identical records, then the winner of their dual meet shall get the top standing. If the tie cannot be resolved by head-to-head records, then the winner shall be determined by adding up total points scored by each team in dual meets against the other tied teams. For example, if teams A, B, and C each have identical records, add points scored for team A in meets against teams B and team C for team A's total. Similarly, add points for teams B and C. The team with the highest point total is the winner. The intent of adding points involving tied teams only is to discourage teams from running up point totals against weaker teams in case of a potential tie.

   3. A banner will be awarded to the winning team in each division and the team winning the Championship Meet. The banners will be presented at the Championship Meet to the respective coaches. Teams winning the banners will bring them to the GPSA Board Meeting following the Championship Meet and turn them in for embroidering. The banners will be returned to the respective teams at the following meeting. All banners will be turned in to GPSA at least one week before the Championship Meet so that they are available for presentation at the meet. Lost or damaged banners will be replaced by the team having possession. Banners will be replaced and old banners retired by GPSA every 10 years.

The Referee and both GPSA Representatives shall confer and may temporarily delay the start or suspend the meet (e.g., in 30-minute increments) to await safe, competitive conditions.\nPostponement: A meet that cannot be safely started or continued may be postponed.\n\nWeather/Facility Postponement: If conditions are clearly unsafe or the facility is unusable, the home team must notify the visiting team’s GPSA Representative and the GPSA Publicity Committee as soon as possible.\nMutual Agreement: A meet may be postponed at any time with the unanimous agreement of both teams’ GPSA Representatives.\n\nRescheduling Process:\n\nUpon postponement, the GPSA Representatives’ first priority is to agree on a date to hold the meet as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., the next day).\nIf an immediate alternative date cannot be mutually agreed upon, the meet shall be held on the next available official league rain date.\nA final, rescheduled date must be confirmed by both Representatives within 24 hours of the initial postponement.\n\nDefining a Completed Meet:\n\nA meet that is stopped and cannot be resumed is considered complete if all events through event 30 (15-18 50M Breast) have been swum.\nIf a meet is stopped before the completion of event 30, it is considered a suspended meet and must be rescheduled and completed at a later date.\nNotwithstanding the above, the two GPSA Representatives may mutually agree that a meet is complete at any point after it has begun.\n\nFailure to Reschedule:\n\nThe collaborative rescheduling of a suspended meet is a primary responsibility of both GPSA Representatives, who are expected to begin discussions on the night of the postponement.\nIf the Representatives fail to agree on a reschedule date within the 24-hour period required by rule 5.3, the meet shall be declared a loss for both teams.",

The intent of adding points involving tied teams only is to discourage teams from running up point totals against weaker teams in case of a potential tie.\nA banner will be awarded to the winning team in each division and the team winning the Championship Meet.

Teams winning the banners will bring them to the GPSA Board Meeting following the Championship Meet and turn them in for embroidering. The banners will be returned to the respective teams at the following meeting.

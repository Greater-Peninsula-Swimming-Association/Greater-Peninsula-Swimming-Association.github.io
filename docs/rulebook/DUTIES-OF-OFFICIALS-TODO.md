**Status:** Pending review and decision
**Date Created:** 2026-01-04

This document captures missing items from the legacy "DUTIES OF OFFICIALS" section that need to be addressed.

---

## 1. Critical Rulebook Items - Proposed Additions

### A. Code of Conduct Enforcement (GPSA Representative)

**Location:** Add to `officials.md` under GPSA Representative section (after item #8)

**Proposed Addition:**

```markdown
### Code of Conduct Enforcement

9. Shall sign and agree to abide by the provisions of the GPSA Code of Conduct.

10. Shall ensure that coaches sign and agree to abide by the provisions of the GPSA Code of Conduct.

11. Shall ensure that the swim team registration contains a Code of Conduct agreement clause with signature blocks for parents and guardians.

12. Shall enforce sanctions imposed by the Rules Committee and the GPSA Board for violations of the Code of Conduct.

13. Shall ensure that signed Code of Conduct forms are filed no later than 7 days before the first scheduled meet. Teams that do not submit signed copies shall forfeit all scheduled meets until the Code is received.

14. A new Code of Conduct must be filed if the GPSA Representative changes or new coaches are added throughout the season.

15. **Suspended/Banned Individuals:** If a suspended or banned individual attends a meet while the suspension or ban is in effect:
    a. The GPSA Representatives from both teams shall approach the individual and respectfully request that they leave the meet (beyond sight and sound).
    b. If the individual willingly leaves, no further action is required and the meet shall proceed normally.
    c. If the individual refuses to leave, the GPSA team that the suspended or banned member belongs to shall forfeit the meet. Swimmers' times from the affected team will not stand.
```

**Questions to Resolve:**
- Is there an actual Code of Conduct document referenced in the constitution or elsewhere?
- Should this be a separate document or appendix?
- Are these rules still current/applicable?

---

### B. Stroke & Turn Judge Hand Signal Requirement

**Location:** Add to `officials.md` under Stroke and Turn Judges section (insert as new item #3)

**Proposed Addition:**

```markdown
3. Must raise their hand with palm open at the time of observing a rule infraction in order for the disqualification to be considered valid.
```

**Current item #3 (dress code) would become item #4**

**Notes:**
- This is a procedural requirement for valid DQs
- Makes infractions visible to referee and coaches
- Standard practice in USA Swimming

---

### C. Referee - Verify Meet Entries Before Start

**Location:** Add to `officials.md` under Meet Referee section (insert as new item #2)

**Proposed Addition:**

```markdown
2. Shall verify that meet entries are complete and in compliance with GPSA rules before the meet begins.
```

**All subsequent items would be renumbered**

**Notes:**
- Ensures compliance before the meet starts
- Prevents issues mid-meet

---

### D. Referee - Postponement Authority

**Location:** Add to `officials.md` under Meet Referee section (as new final item, ~#13)

**Proposed Addition:**

```markdown
12. Shall have authority to postpone the meet or any part of the meet if in their opinion it is desirable because of weather conditions, in consultation with both GPSA Representatives.
```

**Notes:**
- Complements existing postponement rules in conduct-of-meets.md
- Clarifies referee's role in weather decisions

---

### E. Meet Maestro Heat Sheet Publishing & Live Scoring Rules

**Location:** DECISION NEEDED - Options:
1. New section in `conduct-of-meets.md` under "Meet Operations"
2. Under GPSA Representative duties in `officials.md`
3. Under Scorekeeper duties in `officials.md`

**Proposed Addition:**

```markdown
## Heat Sheet and Scoring Publication

1. Both GPSA Representatives must mutually agree to the publication of heat sheets to any mobile app or public platform. Any disagreement shall default to not publishing.

2. Live publishing of meet scoring shall not be enabled or announced during the meet.
```

**Questions to Resolve:**
- Is this still relevant with current Meet Maestro practices?
- Should this be in the rulebook or in operational guidelines?
- What's the reasoning behind these restrictions?

## Next Steps

2. **Decide on Meet Maestro publishing rules** - Are these still needed? Where to place?
3. **Add straightforward items** - Hand signals, entry verification, postponement authority
4. **Create wiki content** - Operational procedures for GPSA Reps and officials
5. **Verify USA Swimming coverage** - Confirm all skipped items are truly covered by references

## Notes

- This represents the final major gap from the legacy DUTIES OF OFFICIALS section
- Most official duties are already well-documented in the new rulebook
- The Code of Conduct enforcement is the largest missing piece
- Many operational items are better suited for wiki documentation

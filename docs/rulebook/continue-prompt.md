## Reference Document

### `docs/rulebook/LEGACY-DIFFERENCES-INTENTIONALLY-SKIPPED.md`

**Purpose:** Historical record of all decisions made during the legacy-to-new rulebook comparison.

**Contents:**

- ~25 items intentionally skipped/ignored with detailed rationale
- 8 items resolved and added to rulebook (Section 13)
- 2 items deferred to wiki documentation
- Summary statistics and categorization

**Value:** Provides institutional memory for future GPSA boards and rules committees.

---

## Remaining Work (Optional)

### Create Wiki Content for Operational Procedures

The following items were identified as better suited for wiki documentation:

1. **Pre-Meet Conference Procedures**
   - Weather policies discussion
   - Officials introduction between teams
   - Review of rule stipulations/modifications
   - Pool-specific logistics

2. **Equipment and Pool Setup**
   - Pre-season inspection of meet equipment
   - Safety verification
   - Operational readiness checks

3. **Ribbon Coordination**
   - Ensuring ribbons are obtained
   - Timely delivery to opposing team

4. **Roster Submission Procedures**
   - SwimTopia export format details
   - Submission email address
   - Step-by-step instructions

**To create wiki content:**
> "Let's create wiki documentation for the operational guide items. Start with [specific topic]."

## Notes for AI Assistant

- **Legacy review is COMPLETE** - No more sections to review
- **Rulebook focus:** Dual meets only (not Championship/invitational meets)
- **USA Swimming references:** Don't duplicate rules covered by USA Swimming
- **Wiki vs Rulebook:** Operational "how-to" goes to wiki, "must do" rules go to rulebook
- **Philosophy:** Content reorganized into logical sections rather than preserving legacy structure

---

## Success Metrics - ACHIEVED ✅

- ✅ Complete coverage of all legacy rulebook content
- ✅ Clear documentation of all decisions made
- ⏳ Wiki content for operational procedures (optional, not started)
- ✅ Clean, modern, well-organized rulebook

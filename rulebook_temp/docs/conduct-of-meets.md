# Conduct of Interpool Meets

This section establishes the procedures and requirements for conducting GPSA dual meets.

## Scheduling and Postponements

1. **Start Time:** League scheduled meets are to be held as scheduled and will start at 6:00 pm.

2. **Warm-up Times:** Both teams shall be given the same amount of time for warm-ups prior to the meet. The home team shall warm-up first, followed by the visiting team.

3. **Meet Delays:** In the event of inclement weather or minor facility issues that arise before or during a meet, every effort should be made to run the meet as planned. The Referee and both GPSA Representatives shall confer and may temporarily delay the start or suspend the meet (e.g., in 30-minute increments) to await safe, competitive conditions.

4. **Postponement:** A meet that cannot be safely started or continued may be postponed.

    1. **Weather/Facility Postponement:** If conditions are clearly unsafe or the facility is unusable, the home team must notify the visiting team's GPSA Representative and the GPSA Publicity Committee as soon as possible.

    2. **Mutual Agreement:** A meet may be postponed at any time with the unanimous agreement of both teams' GPSA Representatives.

5. **Rescheduling Process:**

    1. Upon postponement, the GPSA Representatives' first priority is to agree on a date to hold the meet as soon as reasonably possible (e.g., the next day).

    2. If an immediate alternative date cannot be mutually agreed upon, the meet shall be held on the next available official league rain date.

    3. A final, rescheduled date **must** be confirmed by both Representatives within 24 hours of the initial postponement.

6. **Defining a Completed Meet:**

    1. A meet that is stopped and cannot be resumed is considered **complete** if all events through event 30 (15-18 50M Breast) have been swum.

    2. If a meet is stopped before the completion of event 30, it is considered a **suspended meet** and must be rescheduled and completed at a later date.

    3. Notwithstanding the above, the two GPSA Representatives may mutually agree that a meet is complete at any point after it has begun.

7. **Failure to Reschedule:**

    1. The collaborative rescheduling of a suspended meet is a primary responsibility of both GPSA Representatives, who are expected to begin discussions on the night of the postponement.

    2. If the Representatives fail to agree on a reschedule date within the 24-hour period required by rule 5.3, the meet shall be declared a **loss for both teams.**

## Venue and Code of Conduct

1. Neither smoking nor the consumption of alcoholic beverages will be allowed in the pool area during swim meets. The exact boundaries of this area will be determined by the Referee and both GPSA representatives.
2. Profanity, vulgarity, or disruptive behavior will not be allowed.
3. The use of any audio or visual recording devices, including cell phones, is strictly prohibited in changing areas, rest rooms, locker rooms, or behind the starting blocks.
